\arguments{
\item{t_display}{a data frame necessarily contains the following columns:
ae: the ae term, for example, Amnesia, Abdominal Pain
ae_label: a ae label to classify ae, its value is either ALL/AESER/AEREL...
n1: the number of ae events in the treatment arm
n2: the number of ae events in the control arm
N1: the total sample size in the treatment arm
N2: the total sample size in the control arm
pct_1: the ratio between n1 and N1
pct_2: the ratio between n2 and N2
fig_diff: the difference between pct_1 and pct_2, i.e., pct_1 - pct_2
lower: the lower value of the error bar
upper: the upper value of the error bar}

\item{fig_prop_range}{a numerical vector of length 2 to indicate
the range to plot the two ae proportion, ex., c(-0.05, 0.65)}

\item{fig_prop_label}{a character vector of length 2,
with the first entry indicating the label of the treatment arm,
and the second entry indicating the label of the control arm.
The default value is c("treatment", "control")}

\item{fig_prop_color}{a character vector of length 2,
with the first entry indicating the color of ae proportion in the treatment arm,
and the second entry indicating the color of ae proportion in the control arm.
The default value is c("gold", "purple")}

\item{fig_prop_colwidth}{a numerical value to specify the column width of the two proportion plot
the default value is 300}

\item{fig_diff_range}{a numerical vector of length 2 to indicate
the range to plot the difference between two ae proportion, ex., c(-0.5, 0.5)}

\item{fig_diff_label}{a string to indicate the x-label of the error.
The default value is "treatment <- Favor -> control"}

\item{fig_diff_color}{a string to indicate the color the error.
The default value is "black"}

\item{fig_diff_colwidth}{a numerical value to specify the column width of the two proportion plot
the default value is 300}
}
\value{
a list contain the plotting details, including
design_prop_cell: the Java Script to plot the two ae proportions;
design_diff_cell: the Jave Script to plot the difference of the two ae proportions;
design_prop_footer: a function to design the footer of the two ae proportions;
design_diff_footer: a function to design the footer of the difference between two ae proportions.
