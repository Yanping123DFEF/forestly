\usage{
tidy_observation(
  observation_from,
  observation_where,
  treatment_var = treatment_var,
  treatment_order = treatment_order,
  stratum_var = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{observation_from}{A data frame to obtain observation level variables.
Typically an \code{adae} dataset for time-to-event analysis.
It is the source of variables mentioned in
\code{observation_where}, \code{start_date_var}, \code{end_date_var}, \code{censor_var}.}

\item{observation_where}{A character string to define the criteria to select analysis observation.}

\item{treatment_var}{A character string to define the variable of new column called "treatment".}

\item{treatment_order}{A vector of character strings that tells the function which rows of the table should be select, only if the values in "treatment" is in this vector.
It also provide the label names of the treatments after turning them into factors.}

\item{stratum_var}{A character string to define the variable of baseline stratum in 'population_from'.
Only one 'stratum_var' is allowed.}

\description{
This function is used to prepare the observation datasets for the use in function \code{tidy_ae_table()}.
The function filter the \code{adae} dataset, and define proper treatment order in the dataset.
